## Not Paid For Django

Have a stubborn client who won't pay you? Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished.

## How To Use

Simply change the number of days value on the `check_pay_date` (inside `views.py`) to what you want and add the opacity tag to your body. The function will compare its current date to the payment date and adjust its opacity accordingly.
